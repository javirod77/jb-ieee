We just wanted to remind our lovely Georgia Tech IEEE members that we're always
here looking out for them, and we have some great IEEE resources to share with
you all.

If you're on the hunt for some scholarships, there are plenty of IEEE exclusive
[scholarships available now](http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/students/awards/index.html).
The scholarships vary in amount, deadlines,
requirements, and focus areas, so be sure to check them out and enter by their
respective deadlines.

Also, for those ready to start looking for internships and job offers, IEEE offers
over 900 interview questions and plenty of resume and CV templates available for
you to use right now. Go on over to the [IEEE Resume Lab](http://www.ieee.org/membership_services/membership/resumelab.html)
to learn more.


__Note:__ You will need to be a registered member of IEEE to have access to these
resources. If you haven't registered yet, [here](/membership.html) is where you
can get started.
